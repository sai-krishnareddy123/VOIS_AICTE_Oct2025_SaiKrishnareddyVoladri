The Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis Project aims to explore and analyze booking trends, customer preferences, and pricing patterns using real-world Airbnb data. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data 
analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract meaningful insights.
It highlights:
Seasonal booking demand trends
Price distribution across listings
Popular neighborhoods among travelers
Room type preferences (entire home, private room, shared room)
This analysis helps travelers make better booking decisions, while property owners and analysts gain insights to improve pricing strategies and maximize occupancy.
